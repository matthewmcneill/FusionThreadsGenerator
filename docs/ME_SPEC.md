# Model Engineer (ME) and British Standard Brass (BSB) Thread Specification

The **Model Engineer (ME) thread** is a specialized British thread standard designed specifically for the needs of model engineering, such as building miniature steam locomotives, traction engines, and stationary engines.

Unlike general-purpose threads where the pitch changes with the diameter, the ME standard uses a **constant pitch** system. This allows for fine, shallow threads that are ideal for thin-walled components like boiler tubes.

### 1. History and Origin

* **Establishment:** The ME thread was formalized in **1912** by a committee of the **Society of Model and Experimental Engineers (SMEE)** in the UK.
* **The Problem:** At the time, standard British threads (Whitworth and BSF) were too coarse for small models, often cutting too deep into thin materials. Conversely, "instrument threads" (usually 60 TPI) were often too fine for robust mechanical work.
* **The Solution:** SMEE established a range of threads with a standard **55° Whitworth profile** but with a fixed number of threads per inch (TPI) regardless of the diameter.

### 2. Technical Specifications

The ME thread is defined by its constant pitch and its adherence to the Whitworth geometry.

| Feature | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| **Thread Angle** | 55° (Whitworth form) |
| **Profile** | Symmetrical V-thread with rounded crests and roots |
| **Standard Pitches** | **32 TPI** and **40 TPI** (most common) |
| **Secondary Pitch** | **26 TPI** (often used for larger boiler fittings) |

#### Geometry Formulas
- **Pitch (P):** 1 / Threads Per Inch (TPI)
- **Angular Depth (h):** $0.960491 \times P$
- **Actual Depth (d):** $0.640327 \times P$
- **Root/Crest Radius (r):** $0.137329 \times P$

#### Why "Constant Pitch" Matters
In a standard bolt (like a 1/2" UNC), as the diameter increases, the thread gets coarser. In the ME system, a 1/8" ME and a 1/2" ME screw can both have 40 TPI.

* **Shallow Depth:** Because the pitch is fine (40 TPI), the thread depth remains constant and shallow. This allows you to thread a thin-walled pipe without cutting all the way through the metal.
* **Fine Adjustment:** The fine pitch allows for very precise tightening, which is critical for steam-tight fittings and valves.

### 3. The 26 TPI Series: British Standard Brass (BSB)

The **26 TPI (Threads Per Inch)** series is the heavyweight of the model engineering world. While the "standard" Model Engineer threads are 32 and 40 TPI, the 26 TPI series—frequently referred to as **British Standard Brass (BSB)** or simply **Brass Thread**—is the go-to for larger-scale models and robust boiler fittings.

> [!NOTE]
> For a full technical derivation of BSB threads, see the [BSB Technical Specification](BSB_SPEC.md).

#### The "Brass Thread" Identity
The 26 TPI series is synonymous with brass tube work. Because brass tubing typically has a consistent wall thickness regardless of its diameter, using a standard thread (like BSW) would result in the thread being too deep for larger tubes, effectively cutting the tube in half.
By keeping the pitch constant at 26 TPI, the thread depth remains shallow enough to be safely cut into the side of a thin-walled pipe without compromising its structural integrity.

#### Comparison: BSB (ME) vs. BSC (Cycle)
A common point of confusion in the workshop is the difference between 26 TPI Brass and **26 TPI Cycle (BSC)**.

| Feature | 26 TPI BSB (ME) | 26 TPI BSC (Cycle) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Thread Angle** | 55° | 60° |
| **Common Use** | Boilers, Pipe fittings | Bicycles, Motorcycles |
| **Compatibility** | Not officially compatible | May "force fit" but risks stripping |

> [!NOTE]
> At the 1/4" size, BSF (British Standard Fine) also uses 26 TPI with a 55° angle. This is the only size where a standard fastener thread is identical to the 26 TPI model engineering series.

### 5. Modern Usage

The ME thread remains the "gold standard" in the hobby of live steam model engineering.

* **Niche Availability:** You will not find ME nuts or bolts at a standard hardware store. They are typically sourced from specialist model engineering suppliers.
* **Metric Competition:** While many modern modelers use Metric Fine threads (e.g., M6 x 0.75), the ME thread is still required for anyone building from traditional plans (such as those by LBSC or Martin Evans).
