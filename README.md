# Fusion 360 Thread Generator

This web application allows users to generate custom XML definitions for Fusion 360 thread standards, specifically focusing on British Association (BA), Whitworth (BSW/BSF), Model Engineer (ME), British Standard Brass (BSB), and British Standard Cycle (BSC/CEI) imperial threads.

## How to Use the App

1. **Select a Thread Standard**: Use the dropdown at the top to select the desired standard: **Whitworth**, **British Association (BA)**, **Model Engineer (ME)**, **British Standard Brass (BSB)**, or **Cycle (BSC/CEI)**.
2. **Refine Configuration**:
    - For **Whitworth**, use the checkboxes to toggle between **Standard (BSW)** and **Fine (BSF)** series.
    - Select the desired **Thread Classes** (e.g., Close, Medium, Free) to include in the export.
    - Choose your **Workpiece Material** to optimize target thread engagement.
    - Select the **Drill Bit Sets** available in your workshop.
3. **Review & Customize Sizes**: The app loads standard sizes by default. You can remove existing entries from the table or add custom sizes using the form at the bottom.
4. **Download XML**: Click the **Download XML** button to generate and save the `.xml` file.

## Installation in Fusion 360

To use the custom threads in Fusion 360, you must place the downloaded XML file into the correct `ThreadData` folder on your system.

### Windows Installation Path
Navigate to:
`%localappdata%\Autodesk\webdeploy\Production\<version ID>\Fusion\Server\Fusion\Configuration\ThreadData`

### macOS Installation Path
1. Navigate to: `/Users/[Username]/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Webdeploy/production/[Version ID]`
2. Right-click on the **"Autodesk Fusion 360"** application icon and select **"Show Package Contents"**.
3. Continue the path: `Contents/Libraries/Applications/Fusion/Fusion/Server/Fusion/Configuration/ThreadData`

> [!TIP]
> **Easier Management**: Instead of manual copying, consider using the [ThreadKeeper](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=1725038115223093226) app from the Autodesk App Store. It provides a dedicated UI within Fusion 360 to manage custom thread definitions and preserves them across updates.
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Hidden Files**: Ensure your operating system is set to show hidden files and folders.
> - **Updates**: When Fusion 360 updates to a new version, it creates a new `<version ID>` folder. You will need to copy your custom XML files from the old version folder to the new one.
> - **Reference**: For more details, see the official [Autodesk Support Article](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Custom-Threads-in-Fusion-360.html).

## Thread Standards Overview

The generator supports a range of historical British thread standards, focusing on the pre-metric era.

### Summary Comparison Table

| Thread Type | Angle | Typical Use Case | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BSW/BSF** | 55° | General engineering, motorcycles (pre-Unified). | ✅ Implemented |
| **BA** | 47.5° | Electrical fittings, instruments, modeling. | ✅ Implemented |
| **ME** | 55° | Small scale steam models and carburetors. | ✅ Implemented |
| **BSC / CEI** | 60° | Bicycles and motorcycles (BSA, Norton, Triumph). | ✅ Implemented |
| **BSP** | 55° | Plumbing and hydraulic systems. | 📋 Under consideration, but Fusion already has BSP threads. |
| **BSB** | 55° | Brass lamps, gas fittings, thin-walled tubing. | ✅ Implemented |

### 1. Whitworth-Form Threads (55° Angle)
Classic 55-degree flank angle with rounded crests and roots.
- **BSW (British Standard Whitworth)**: General engineering and heavy machinery. [Technical Spec](docs/WHITWORTH_SPEC.md)
- **BSF (British Standard Fine)**: Finer alternative to BSW, used where vibration is a concern. [Technical Spec](docs/WHITWORTH_SPEC.md)
- **BSP (British Standard Pipe)**:
    - **BSPP (Parallel)**: "G" threads. [Technical Spec](docs/BSPP_SPEC.md)
    - **BSPT (Taper)**: "R" threads.
- **BSB (British Standard Brass)**: Specialized for brass tubing; constant pitch of **26 TPI**. [Technical Spec](docs/BSB_SPEC.md)
- **BS Con (British Standard Conduit)**: Also known as **ET** or **BS 31**.
- **ME (Model Engineer)**: Miniature threads for small boilers and steam models. [Technical Spec](docs/ME_SPEC.md)

### 2. British Association (BA) (47.5° Angle)
- **BA (British Association)**: Unique 47.5° angle. Standard for electrical equipment and instruments. [Technical Spec](docs/BA_SPEC.md)

### 3. Cycle Threads (60° Angle)
- **BSC / BSCy (British Standard Cycle)**: Successor to **CEI**. [Technical Spec](docs/BSC_SPEC.md)
- **BSA Motorcycle**: Heavier 20 TPI variant for larger sizes.

### 4. Specialized Industry Threads
- **ADM (Admiralty Fine)**: Niche standard for the Royal Navy.
- **BS 341 (Gas Cylinder)**: Taper thread for cylinder valves.
- **BS 336 (Fire Hose)**: Robust "round" thread form.

> [!TIP]
> **Drill Selection**: All supported threads use our advanced [Tapping Drill Specification](docs/DRILL_SPEC.md) for tool selection.
>
> **Future Plans**: For a detailed list of planned features and work, check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Developer Guide - Build & Deploy

This project is built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- `npm` (comes with Node.js)

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start development server
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Testing
We use **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** for our test suite.
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest

# Open Vitest UI (interactive dashboard)
npm run test:ui
```

### Build & Deploy to GitHub Pages
To build and deploy the application:
```bash
# Build for production and deploy
npm run deploy
```

**How it works:**
- `npm run deploy` triggers `predeploy` which runs `npm run build` (vite build).
- The production bundle is generated in the `dist/` directory.
- The `gh-pages` package pushes `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch.
